                <p>"Hi, my name is Rusty and I am 7 years old, and my birthday is  October 22, 2008. I weigh 16 pounds and currently live in Yuba City, California with my owners Linda and Terry Brown.  At the moment, I am an only dog.  Recently I found out about my family tree.  I come from a long line of dogs in Germany called the Dachshund family; we are hounds and were bred to hunt and chase animals that burrow.
                <br><br>
                I don't do much hunting today, but don't let my size fool you;  I can keep up with any big dog.  In my spare time, I especially love to run, play with a ball and go for bicycle rides in my cart.  When I am tired, I nap in the sun or in front of the fireplace.  My normal body temperature is 101 so I get cold easily because of  my smooth, short, red hair.  My eyes are a deep brown color and can be most soulful.  I was born with pink toe nails and in my 7 years,  I have not seen another dachshund with pink toe nails.  I have a large wardrobe of clothes: sweaters, collars, leashes, jackets, even a tuxedo!  I try to change up what I wear when visiting shut-ins; at Christmas, my tuxedo gets me lots of attention!   Sometimes I get gifts from people I have just met.  Last week a 100 year old lady knitted  me a cozy blanket. My teeth get brushed every night so my breath does not smell bad when I visit the care homes.  My sparkling white teeth seem to make people laugh when Terry shows them off!
                <br><br>
                My life is not all play;  when I was one, I graduated from obedience school and my good manners and sweet nature now enable me to work as a therapy dog through the Delta Corporation.  To train, Terry took me everywhere he went so that I  would become accustomed to being handled by and talked to by people. Terry and I visit people in care homes, hospitals, and hospice situations in the Yuba-Sutter area.  When I was asked to visit a young man who only had four weeks to live, Terry told him to wave at me and when he did, I waved back with my right paw.  The man got a belly laugh that lasted the longest time!  He was so happy and it made me feel so good to have made him laugh.  That was the only time I got to visit him but I will always remember his laughter.
                <br><br>
                After my back was injured, I was operated on and during my 8 week recovery I was taken to visit my friends in the care homes in a special dog stroller.  This put me at the right height to be petted by the people sitting or in bed.
                <br><br>
                People always seem happy to see me and I really enjoy all the back scratches and pats.  Terry and I like to take gifts each week to people in the care homes such as backscratchers, hand lotion, and socks.  I get lots of hugs for doing this.  If you see me around, just ask me to wave at you and you will laugh too!"</p>
